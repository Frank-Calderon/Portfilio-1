                <p>My name is Frank and I am an aspiring <strong>full-stack developer</strong>.</p>
                <p>Always having been in love with tech, I learned from an early age how to tinker with computer hardware. Now I'm interested on what makes the hardware work and excited to persue a career in coding </p>
                <p>While I have a background in Finance and Art, I'm very excited to prove that anyone can learn anything and apply that knowledge in a meaningful way.</p>
                <p>During this program, I attend informative lectures and take part in a variety of individual and
                    team
                    exercises, working independently and in groups, in the classroom and at home.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To build my projects, I have to combine my knowledges of frond-end and back-end technologies.</p>
